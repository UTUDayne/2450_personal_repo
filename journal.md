I demonstrated my website in project 1 of Web Application Development. From what I could see it was the best designed website, and I got a 100% along with everyone else.

09/5/2025: I learned how to attach a public key to a mailfence email, and that is by using the attachments option, not just signing the email. I also learned the Bubble sort, shaker sort, and counting sort algorithms, where shaker sort was the fastest of them if the list is already mostly sorted, but can become n^2 if randomly sorted. A third thing I learned was that JS DOM querySelector only grabs the first item in a class, while querySelectorAll grabs every item.

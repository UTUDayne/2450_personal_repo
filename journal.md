I demonstrated my website in project 1 of Web Application Development. From what I could see it was the best designed website, and I got a 100% along with everyone else.

Yesterday I had the interesting situation of answering a question Bart said in a very software engineering-esque way, while the person behind me said effectively the same thing but in a more advanced, computer sciencey way. I thought it was interesting to get reconfirmed on why I chose SE over CS

I learned a lot about JavaScript today, and I think it is interesting how it seems to be a halfway point from c++ to python.

09/5/2025: I learned how to attach a public key to a mailfence email, and that is by using the attachments option, not just signing the email. I also learned the Bubble sort, shaker sort, and counting sort algorithms, where shaker sort was the fastest of them if the list is already mostly sorted, but can become n^2 if randomly sorted. A third thing I learned was that JS DOM querySelector only grabs the first item in a class, while querySelectorAll grabs every item.

09/12/2025: The most important things I learned this week was to make sure I don't mistake - for = in code, that python uses an algorithm called powersort which is stable, unlike quicksort, and to read quiz questions more carefully, even if I have multiple attempts.

09/20/2025: I have experimented and found that just leaving the controller physically connected to the Xbox one seems to work, will try with the Series X. I have learned about using flask, and have learned the acronym ACAO, for Access-Control-Allow-Origin. For the security+ midterm, I memorized the documents and error codes, but those turned out to be unnessessary. Sp-800.53 helps with securing your company, and I have associated it with the Ferrari SP 500 and think of it as the Ferrari sp 800 53. Certificates are formated in x.509v3 and CRLs are x.509v2
